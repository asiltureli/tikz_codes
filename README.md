# tikz_codes
This repository contains the tikz codes I wrote for my Bachelor Thesis and Seminar Paper.  
Some of them are completely written by me, some of them have been hardly modified in order to meet my needs, using some code snippets I found on Internet(mostly stackoverflow).
Content will be updated, if I write any new codes.

Everyone is free to use, without any notice or citation.
